# smogon_formatter
Format your Smogon thread once and apply it to all of your Pokemon

Do you ever get tired of formatting each and every Pokemon in your Smogon thread?  Well, with a little bit of programming, you'll only have to edit them once and you can apply the changes to every Pokemon.  Here's what you'll need:

* Ruby (the programming language, not the GBA game)
* JSON gem
* Basic knowledge about HTML
* Very basic knowledge of programming

If you have a Mac or other UNIX based machine, Ruby should already be installed.  To check, open your Terminal and type Ruby -v.  This should return a Ruby version number.  For Windows users, you'll have to download Ruby from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads.  To install the JSON gem, simply issue the command

`` gem install json ``

Next, head over to YouTube for a quick demonstration.
